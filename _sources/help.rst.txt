Getting Help
============

If you are having trouble with CyberGISX or CyberGIS-Compute, a good first place to start is the `Get Started <https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/get-started/>`_ page on CyberGISXHub.

The `FAQ <https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/faq/>`_ and `Knowledge Base <https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/knowledge-base/>`_ are also very helpful resources.
